# Textual Entailment Using SNLI

## Overview
This project focuses on **Textual Entailment** (Natural Language Inference - NLI) using the **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI)** dataset. The goal is to classify whether a given hypothesis is **entailment, contradiction, or neutral** in relation to a given premise.

## Dataset
The **SNLI dataset** is a benchmark dataset for natural language inference. It consists of 570K human-annotated sentence pairs labeled as:
- **Entailment**: The hypothesis logically follows from the premise.
- **Contradiction**: The hypothesis contradicts the premise.
- **Neutral**: The hypothesis neither entails nor contradicts the premise.

You can download the dataset from [SNLI Dataset](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/).

## Model
The model can be implemented using various deep learning architectures such as:

- **Simple feed-forward networks with sentence embeddings**
- **LSTM-based models**

## Results
Performance is evaluated using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**. The final trained model achieves **X% accuracy** on the SNLI test set.
